# About
Our application is designed to help students stay organized and on top of their assignments and classes. Our app brings multiple providers together into one user interface, making it easier to organize everything for assignments and classes. This application includes a sign-up page, followed by a calendar to allow students to input their schedule. For this app, we used ReactJS and Flask as our frontend and backend.
